This repository contains the code I wrote in the college programming module based around Java. This module ran for a full semester and the programmes written can be found under the repective weeks they were written. I have further broken the code within each week into the specific topics that were covered within each week.

This module was titled **'Object Oriented Programming'** and the content contained within it is based around this paradigm.

Throughout this course, the topics covered the basics of Java and also explored further programming contepts. These content covered is broken down as follows:

- Week 1 - datatypes, if statements, and running java programmes,

- Week 2 - methods, while loops and for loops,

- Week 3 - intArrays and other practice programmes,

- Week 4 - classes, arrays, the command line, and exceptions,

- Week 5 - classes in more detail, interfaces, sentiment analysis alorithms and other practice programmes,

- Week 6 - maps, hashSets and other collections, and generic classes,

- Week 7 - inheritance.
